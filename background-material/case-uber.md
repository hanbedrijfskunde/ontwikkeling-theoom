AMNA NAWAZ: Uber's impending initial public offering is expected to be one of the largest
0:04
ever.
0:05
Our economics correspondent, Paul Solman, recently visited their headquarters to better
0:09
understand what happens when a San Francisco company puts economists in the driver's seat.
0:14
It's the latest installment of Making Sense, our weekly economics series.
0:18
CORY KENDRICK, Senior Data Science Manager, Uber: We're in 65 countries, and we see about
0:21
15 million trips a day.
0:23
PAUL SOLMAN: Uber, these days literally all over the map.
0:26
CORY KENDRICK: So, you will see the biggest circles are where we see the most trips happening
0:29
on our platform.
0:30
PAUL SOLMAN: Uber data scientist Cory Kendrick can track every ride worldwide, and there
0:36
have been tons of them.
0:37
CORY KENDRICK: About 10 billion trips since we started.
0:38
PAUL SOLMAN: Here at Uber's San Francisco headquarters, the resulting data is analyzed
0:43
by a team of in-house economists.
0:45
JONATHAN HALL, Chief Economist, Uber: My guess is, overall, between 20 and 30 Ph.Ds.
0:49
PAUL SOLMAN: Jonathan Hall is Uber's chief economist.
0:52
His mission?
0:53
JONATHAN HALL: Writing papers, publishing them, and trying to establish ground truth
0:58
on tricky issues like the value of flexibility to the work force.
1:03
PAUL SOLMAN: Of course, Uber's economists need to protect its bottom line, help it stay
1:07
ahead of the competition.
1:09
But Uber presents an unusual opportunity, the realization of many an economist's s dream,
1:15
efficient markets.
1:16
Case in point, surge pricing.
1:18
JONATHAN HALL: Economists really don't like the idea of the price not being able to change
1:22
when supply or demand changes.
1:24
We have this algorithm called the surge algorithm whose purpose is to identify imbalances between
1:31
supply and demand and solve them in a way that maximizes the efficiency of the market.
1:36
PAUL SOLMAN: So when more passengers demand rides, prices go up to entice more drivers
1:42
to supply them.
1:43
Or take Uber's controversial, oft-criticized labor model.
1:46
JONATHAN HALL: The drivers, who are independent contractors, can choose to work whenever they
1:50
want or wherever they want, with essentially no restrictions.
1:53
And that's very exciting to an economist who believes in open markets and competition.
1:59
PAUL SOLMAN: So you are the embodiment of what economists would like an economy to look
2:04
like?
2:05
(LAUGHTER)
2:06
JONATHAN HALL: I think we strive for that.
2:10
PAUL SOLMAN: So Hall's economics squad is mining the vast data collected by the Uber
2:15
app to understand driver and passenger behavior, and to tweak it.
2:20
JONATHAN HALL: Women, on average, tend to do fewer trips per unit of time than men.
2:24
PAUL SOLMAN: One study analyzed data from over a million drivers to find a 7 percent
2:29
gender earnings gap.
2:31
PAUL OYER, Stanford Graduate School of Business: We know it's not discrimination.
2:33
There's a formula that determines how much they make.
2:35
PAUL SOLMAN: Stanford economist Paul Oyer, who did the research with Uber, says women
2:39
make less for a less obvious reason.
2:41
PAUL OYER: They drive slower.
2:43
So, the faster you drive, the more revenue you're generating, because you're getting
2:47
more rides in per hour.
2:49
PAUL SOLMAN: And since men give more rides, they get more experience.
2:53
PAUL OYER: So if you go out and get in an Uber right now, and there's a man driving,
2:57
and then you go out and get in an Uber with a woman driving, on average, that man will
3:02
have had more experience driving for Uber, and therefore he will be better at it and
3:07
he will earn more money.
3:09
PAUL SOLMAN: While we were there, the Uber team explored one possible tweak.
3:12
ALISON STEIN, Uber: Having this per-mile component essentially mechanically rewards for speed.
3:18
So, what this intervention considers is weighting less heavily on this per-mile and more heavily
3:24
on this per-minute.
3:25
PAUL SOLMAN: Data is the driver, about tipping, for example, introduced in 2017.
3:29
JONATHAN HALL: We consider the rollout of tipping to be an important experiment and
3:36
opportunity that -- to get it right.
3:38
And so you will see changes happening over time.
3:40
PAUL SOLMAN: Because you're constantly testing, does this make people more generous towards
3:45
drivers or less inclined to use Uber, or both?
3:48
JONATHAN HALL: Both.
3:49
PAUL SOLMAN: But using the key metric of economics, the cost of losing customers, was outweighed
3:55
by the benefit of more motivated drivers.
4:00
Stanford economist Susan Athey many tech companies now employ economists to run the numbers.
4:05
SUSAN ATHEY, Stanford Graduate School of Business: You have a bit of this image of Silicon Valley
4:08
that somebody is sitting there, you know, thinking of a brilliant idea, you know, alone
4:11
in a room, and then putting it into practice.
4:14
But, actually, the real innovation that happens, especially for the larger tech firms, is just
4:19
lots and lots and lots of incremental innovation, randomized controlled tests, thousands of
4:24
them a year, to try to improve algorithms, to try to improve systems to make them better.
4:30
PAUL SOLMAN: Better, which ultimately means more profitable, whether consumers are on
4:34
board or not.
4:36
Jonathan Hall and I took an Uber with Hayley McGonigle, who says the algorithms keep her
4:40
busy, happily busy.
4:42
HAYLEY MCGONIGLE, Uber Driver: I think a lot of the improvements lately have been to keep
4:47
drivers constantly busy.
4:49
Any time you don't have a rider, that's, of course, lost wages right there.
4:53
PAUL SOLMAN: McGonigle was provided by Uber.
4:55
She works morning rush hours, says she makes $35 an hour.
5:00
But for some San Francisco drivers, the economist's dream can be the worker's nightmare.
5:04
MOSTAFA MAKLAD, Uber Driver: They have been decreasing how much money they pay to drivers
5:09
year after year.
5:11
PAUL SOLMAN: Mostafa Maklad has been driving for almost four years.
5:14
MOSTAFA MAKLAD: Instead of working like 40 hours a week, I'm forced to work at least
5:19
60, 70, 80 hours a week in order to pay my bills and pay all my expenses.
5:26
PAUL SOLMAN: Bay Area drivers for Uber and rival Lyft have been protesting low pay with
5:32
no benefits.
5:33
Meanwhile, the IPOs of both companies will make many of their actual employees rich.
5:38
MICHAEL MARTINEZ, Uber Driver: There's a lot of frustration out there.
5:41
PAUL SOLMAN: Michael Martinez drives for Uber about 20 to 25 hours a week.
5:45
MICHAEL MARTINEZ: If you include all of the costs, and you also include the constant rate
5:52
cuts that have been going on over the last four years I have been doing it, I'm probably
5:57
getting pretty close to just what San Francisco's minimum wage would be, to be honest.
6:02
PAUL SOLMAN: Uber says there have been rate changes in both directions.
6:05
But that doesn't mitigate the impotence drivers feel in the hands of a faceless, forever-tweaked
6:11
algorithm.
6:12
MOSTAFA MAKLAD: Whenever they do any changes, we are forced to accept and agree to their
6:17
terms in order to go online and start driving.
6:20
MICHAEL MARTINEZ: We have absolutely no power whatsoever.
6:24
Uber does as they will, and we have no choice but to accept it.
6:29
PAUL SOLMAN: But, despite their gripes, both Maklad and Martinez continue to drive.
6:34
MICHAEL MARTINEZ: The main draw is the flexibility.
6:35
MOSTAFA MAKLAD: To be honest, it's the only job that I can do while going to school.
6:42
PAUL SOLMAN: Unsurprisingly, Uber economists like Libby Mishkin studied the value of flexibility.
6:47
ELIZABETH MISHKIN, Senior Economist, Uber: Drivers worked more as a result of this flexibility,
6:51
because they don't have to commit to doing something that they might not want to do later.
6:55
They can just choose to work whenever they feel like it.
6:57
PAUL SOLMAN: The economists also use data to answer critics on a myriad of issues, like
7:02
the charge that uber increases congestion in cities like New York, Uber rides lighting
7:07
up the city on this map.
7:08
CORY KENDRICK: There's really mixed evidence.
7:10
And so one thing we're trying to do is make sure there's more rigorous research out there,
7:15
trying to get at this question.
7:16
It's really hard to study, for a number of reasons.
7:20
One is that there has been a lot of economic growth in the last 10 years, and there's more
7:23
traffic when that happens.
7:24
PAUL SOLMAN: Suppose you did a study and found that Uber was the main contributor to congestion
7:31
problems in New York, San Francisco, and elsewhere.
7:36
Wouldn't you be constrained from telling everybody that that's the case?
7:41
CORY KENDRICK: Some of these questions may be tough questions for us, but we would rather
7:46
know the answer than not know.
7:47
Congestion is bad for Uber too.
7:49
Our cars will be going slower.
7:51
We also have bikes and scooters, which are new modes on the platform that are trying
7:54
to get people out of cars and into active modes.
7:57
PAUL SOLMAN: In short, more tweaking, with the data from mega-millions of customers leading
8:02
the way.
8:03
And that's the new world of economics, says Susan Athey.
8:06
SUSAN ATHEY: Right now, it's the Googles and the Amazons and the Ubers, but it's going
8:10
to be the banks and it's going to be other manufacturing firms.
8:14
So, really, all parts of the economy are going to digitize and start optimizing in a more
8:18
scientific way.
8:19
Eventually, it will all get routine.
8:21
PAUL SOLMAN: Because of the information you and I provide.
