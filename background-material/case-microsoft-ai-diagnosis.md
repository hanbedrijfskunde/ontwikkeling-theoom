>> A STEP TOWARD MEDICAL
0:07
SUPERINTELLIGENCE. THAT'S WHAT
0:08
THE CEO OF MICROSOFT IS CALLING
0:09
THE COMPANY'S NEW ARTIFICIAL
0:11
INTELLIGENCE TOOL. SO MICROSOFT
0:13
SAYS IT CAN DIAGNOSE PATIENTS
0:16
FOUR TIMES MORE ACCURATELY THAN
0:17
DOCTORS AND AT A FRACTION OF THE
0:18
COST. SO WITH PEOPLE
0:19
INCREASINGLY TURNING TO THE
0:21
INTERNET TO DIAGNOSE THEIR
0:23
HEALTH TROUBLES, MICROSOFT SAYS,
0:24
I COULD BE TRANSFORMATIONAL. SO
0:26
I WANT TO BRING IN WILL KNIGHT,
0:27
A SENIOR WRITER FOR WIRED, TO
0:30
TALK ABOUT THIS NEW A.I. TOOL.
0:31
THANKS FOR JOINING US. LET'S GET
0:32
RIGHT TO IT. TELL US ABOUT IT.
0:34
>> SURE. YEAH. SO THIS IS THIS
0:35
IS A, YOU KNOW, EXCITING STEP IN
0:39
THIS LONG STANDING VISION TO TO
0:41
USE A.I. TO HELP WITH MEDICAL
0:44
DIAGNOSIS. PLENTY OF WORK HAS
0:45
SHOWN THAT LANGUAGE MODELS, SUCH
0:48
AS THOSE USED IN CHATGPT, CAN
0:50
CAN POTENTIALLY DIAGNOSE
0:53
PEOPLE'S ILLNESS. BUT THIS IS
0:55
THE MOST REALISTIC SIMULATION OF
0:57
THE WAY DOCTORS DO IT. THEY HAD
0:58
THE THE MODEL DO THINGS LIKE
1:00
DEVISE WHAT TESTS A PATIENT
1:02
SHOULD BE GIVEN, AND GO INTO THE
1:04
BACK AND FORTH WITH THAT IS
1:07
INVOLVED WITH DIAGNOSING
1:07
SOMETHING. SO IT'S STILL EARLY
1:09
STAGES, YOU KNOW. BUT THIS THIS
1:10
SHOWS THE POTENTIAL OF A.I. AND
1:12
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE A LOT OF
1:13
PITFALLS. THERE ARE A LOT OF
1:14
ISSUES TO CONSIDER, BUT ONE OF
1:16
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ALSO
1:17
IS THAT THIS THIS SHOWS THAT
1:18
THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR A.I. TO
1:20
REDUCE THE COST, WHICH IS
1:22
OBVIOUSLY SUCH A HUGE ISSUE IN
1:23
HEALTHCARE.
1:25
>> YEAH, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.
1:25
WE KNOW THAT HEALTH CARE IS
1:27
EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE, SO HOW
1:29
COULD THIS TOOL REALLY LOWER THE
1:31
COSTS?
1:32
>> SO IN THEIR IN THEIR
1:33
EXPERIMENT, AT LEAST THEY HAD
1:35
THE MODEL OR THE SERIES OF
1:37
MODELS OPTIMIZED FOR COST. SO
1:38
TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET
1:40
THE RIGHT TREATMENT, GET THE
1:42
RIGHT DIAGNOSIS. BUT FACTOR COST
1:43
INTO THAT AND REDUCE THE COSTS.
1:45
AND SO THAT BECAUSE THE SYSTEM
1:48
IS IS IN SOME WAYS, YOU KNOW,
1:49
THEY CALL IT SUPERINTELLIGENT OR
1:50
A STEP TOWARDS
1:52
SUPERINTELLIGENCE, BUT IT CAN IT
1:53
CAN FACTOR IN A LOT MORE DATA
1:54
THAN, THAN A DOCTOR. SO
1:56
POTENTIALLY IT COULD IT COULD
1:58
HELP REDUCE SOME OF THOSE, THOSE
2:00
COSTS THAT GET INCURRED WITH
2:02
TREATING PATIENTS. I SHOULD
2:03
CAUTION THAT THERE ARE OTHER
2:04
FACTORS THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS
2:05
THIS NEEDS TO BE TESTED IN A IN
2:06
A CLINICAL TRIAL, REALLY,
2:08
BECAUSE THERE ARE THINGS THAT
2:09
THE A.I. DOESN'T CONSIDER, LIKE
2:13
YOUR DOCTOR MAY KNOW WHAT
2:14
INSTRUMENTS ARE AVAILABLE OR
2:14
WHAT KIND OF TESTS A PATIENT
2:15
WOULD BE WILLING TO TO HAVE, AND
2:18
MAY FACTOR THAT INTO THEIR
2:21
CONSIDERATION. SO, YOU KNOW,
2:21
IT'S EARLY DAYS, BUT THERE IS
2:22
THE POTENTIAL THERE TO REDUCE
2:23
THOSE COSTS.
2:25
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN,
2:26
THERE IS THE PATIENT HISTORY AND
2:27
THE CONNECTION THAT A PATIENT
2:28
MAY HAVE WITH THE DOCTOR. SO HOW
2:30
WILL THE AVERAGE PERSON BE ABLE
2:32
TO USE THIS TOOL, AND HOW WILL
2:33
IT ACTUALLY TAKE THE PLACE OF A
2:35
DOCTOR? I KNOW THIS IS THE
2:39
INITIAL STAGES.
2:39
>> YEAH. SO I MEAN, THE I THINK
2:40
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE
2:42
MICROSOFT EXECUTIVE STRESSED TO
2:43
ME WAS THAT IT'S STILL AN EARLY
2:45
STAGE. THEY HAVEN'T DECIDED HOW
2:46
THEY'RE GOING TO DEPLOY IT, BUT
2:48
THEY DID NOTE THAT A LOT OF
2:49
PEOPLE GO TO THEIR SEARCH
2:53
SERVICE, BING AND ENTER, YOU
2:53
KNOW, INFORMATION TRYING TO GET
2:54
A DIAGNOSIS. SO WE MAY WELL SEE
2:56
THIS SORT OF THING BE
2:58
IMPLEMENTED IN IN THOSE KINDS OF
2:59
TOOLS THAT ARE ALREADY WIDELY
3:01
USED TO TRY AND DIAGNOSE
3:02
ILLNESS. BUT IT COULD ALSO
3:04
POTENTIALLY HELP DOCTORS, YOU
3:06
KNOW, DOCTORS ALREADY RELY ON A
3:08
LOT OF TECHNOLOGY. AND ONE ONE
3:09
IMPORTANT THING TO STRESS WITH
3:10
THIS TEST IS THAT THEY ASK THE
3:12
DOCTORS TO TRY AND MAKE THESE
3:13
DIAGNOSES WITHOUT ACCESS TO
3:14
THOSE TOOLS, SO THEY WOULD
3:15
POTENTIALLY BE, YOU KNOW, A
3:17
SIGNIFICANT DISADVANTAGE. AND
3:18
BUT WITH THIS, THEY COULD BE AT
3:19
A BIG, BIG ADVANTAGE BECAUSE
3:21
THEY COULD USE SOMETHING THAT
3:22
CAN FACTOR IN A LOT MORE DATA, A
3:25
LOT MORE INFORMATION, AND
3:27
ANALYZE ALL THOSE RECORDS

## Discussion Questions for Students

### 1. From Warehouse Workers to Doctors - The 6th S Escalates
**Context**: We started with Amazon's 6th S: Substitute (warehouse workers). Now Microsoft's 6th S: Substitute (doctors).

**Kernvraag**: If "superintelligence" can replace medical expertise, what's sacred? Where does Lean's "respect for people" actually mean something? Or is efficiency always the ultimate value?

**Progressie analyse**:
- **Case 1 (Uber)**: Substitute taxi drivers with gig workers + algorithms
- **Case 2 (Dark Factories)**: Substitute factory operators with robots
- **Case 3 (Amazon)**: Substitute warehouse workers with 1M+ robots
- **Case 4 (Microsoft)**: Substitute doctors with AI diagnosis

**Vragen**:
- Patroon: Eerst low-skill (warehouse), dan mid-skill (factory), nu high-skill (medical). Wat is next?
- Argument was altijd: "Automation replaces routine tasks, humans do creative/expert work." Maar diagnosis IS expert work. Is dit argument nu dood?
- Als AI 4× beter diagnoseert dan doctors, wat is de moral case voor keeping human doctors?
- Is er een type werk dat inherently "should" be done by humans, regardless of efficiency?

### 2. "Optimized for Cost" in Healthcare - Ethics of Efficiency
**Context**: Microsoft's AI was explicitly "optimized for cost" - factor cost into diagnosis decisions.

**Scenario**: Patient presents symptoms that could be:
- Disease A: 70% probability, test costs $50
- Disease B: 25% probability, test costs $5,000
- Disease C: 5% probability, test costs $20,000

**AI Logic (optimized for cost)**:
1. Test for A ($50)
2. If negative, assume B or C based on additional symptoms
3. Skip expensive tests unless strong indicators

**Doctor Logic (optimized for patient)**:
1. Consider patient anxiety, medical history, risk tolerance
2. Sometimes order expensive test for peace of mind
3. Factor in liability, trust relationship, patient values

**Vragen**:
- TIM WOOD vraag: Is dat $20,000 test "waste" (Overprocessing) of "value" (peace of mind, thoroughness)?
- Als AI is "4× more accurate" maar "optimized for cost," wie wint bij trade-off: accuracy of affordability?
- Microsoft CEO: "Step toward medical superintelligence." Maar "superintelligence" ten behoeve van patient of insurance company?
- In healthcare Value Stream Mapping: Wat is de "value" die door process loopt? Accurate diagnosis of cost-efficient diagnosis?

### 3. The Unfair Test - Methodology Matters
**Context**: Video reveals crucial detail: "They asked doctors to try and make these diagnoses WITHOUT ACCESS TO THOSE TOOLS, so they would potentially be at a significant disadvantage."

**Test setup**:
- **Doctors**: Geen access tot diagnostische tools (blood tests, imaging, databases)
- **AI**: Alle data beschikbaar, alle medical literature, pattern recognition across millions of cases

**Vergelijking**:
| Resource | Doctors (in test) | AI | Doctors (in reality) |
|----------|-------------------|-----|---------------------|
| **Diagnostic tools** | None (stripped) | All data | All tools available |
| **Medical literature** | Memory only | Complete corpus | Reference materials |
| **Past cases** | Personal experience | Millions of cases | Hospital records |
| **Time pressure** | Limited | Instant processing | Variable |

**Vragen**:
- Is dit een fair comparison? AI with tools vs. doctors without tools?
- Wat zou gebeuren met: Doctors WITH tools + AI assistance vs. AI alone?
- Microsoft zegt: "Doctors could use this to be at BIG advantage." Maar waarom vergelijken we dan niet "Doctor + AI" vs. "AI alone"?
- DOVE-cyclus: **Diagnosticeren** phase - als je test methodology is flawed, is je hele improvement cycle gebaseerd op verkeerde conclusie?

**Lean principe**: Ga naar Gemba, observeer actual work. Maar deze test gebeurt NIET in actual clinical setting. Wat mis je?

### 4. What AI Doesn't Capture - The Intangibles
**Context**: Video lists what AI doesn't consider: "Instruments available, what tests patient would be willing to have, patient history, connection with doctor."

**Tangible vs. Intangible Value**:

**Tangible (AI excels)**:
- Pattern matching across symptoms
- Speed (instant vs. days for doctor consultation)
- Cost ($X per AI diagnosis vs. $XXX per doctor visit)
- Consistency (same symptoms → same diagnosis)

**Intangible (AI misses)**:
- Trust: Patient believes diagnosis because they trust their doctor
- Context: Doctor knows patient is anxious, tends to catastrophize
- Nuance: Patient says "fine" but body language says otherwise
- Accountability: Who do you sue if AI misdiagnosis kills someone?
- Relationship: Patient discloses sensitive info because of 10-year relationship

**Vragen**:
- Table VII toepassing: Welke Lean tool + Industry 4.0 tech combinatie is dit?
  - VSM + AI = Map diagnostic process, optimize with machine learning?
  - Gemba Walk + Digital Twin = Simulate patient journey virtually?
- Maar: Kan je "trust" en "relationships" in een Value Stream Mapping? Zo niet, zijn ze dan irrelevant?
- TIM WOOD: Is "taking time to build patient trust" waste (Waiting) of value creation?
- If we optimize healthcare for efficiency (fast, cheap, accurate diagnosis), but patients don't trust the diagnosis, is that net positive?

### 5. Bing Diagnosis - Democratization or Disaster?
**Context**: Microsoft says deployment could be "in those kinds of tools that are ALREADY WIDELY USED to try and diagnose illness" - referring to Bing search.

**Scenario**: Patient googles symptoms → Bing AI gives diagnosis → Patient acts on it.

**Possible Outcomes**:
- **Positive**: Catch serious conditions early (AI says "chest pain + shortness of breath = ER now!")
- **Negative**: Misdiagnosis (AI misses context, patient delays seeing real doctor)
- **Anxiety**: AI lists 15 possible conditions, patient panics
- **Liability**: Patient sues Microsoft when AI diagnosis is wrong?

**Vragen**:
- Is this "democratizing healthcare access" (good) of "replacing medical professionals with search engine" (bad)?
- Amazon's VP: "Man with machine, not man versus machine." Microsoft's vision: Patient WITH AI, or patient INSTEAD OF doctor?
- Lean principe: Eliminate middlemen (waste). Is doctor a "middleman" between patient and diagnosis?
- DOVE-cyclus **Evalueren**: What's success metric?
  - Option A: # of people using Bing for diagnosis (usage)
  - Option B: % of accurate diagnoses (quality)
  - Option C: # of lives saved vs. harm caused (net benefit)
  - Option D: Cost savings to healthcare system (efficiency)

**Welke metric kiest Microsoft? Welke zou Lean kiezen?**

### 6. Professional Work in the Age of Superintelligence
**Context**: Progression across all 4 cases shows automation climbing skill ladder. Microsoft represents professional services automation.

**Traditional Automation Narrative**:
1. Automate physical labor (factories, warehouses) ✓
2. Automate cognitive routine tasks (data entry, basic customer service) ✓
3. Humans focus on creative, expert, interpersonal work ✓
4. **NEW**: Automate expert work (medical diagnosis, legal analysis, engineering design)

**If Step 4 is now possible, what's left?**

**Analyse per job type**:
| Job Type | Automatable? | Microsoft Case Evidence |
|----------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Routine manual** | Yes (Amazon robots) | Warehouse picking, sorting |
| **Routine cognitive** | Yes (Uber algorithms) | Route optimization, pricing |
| **Non-routine manual** | Partial (Dark Factories) | Robot maintenance, supervision |
| **Non-routine cognitive** | Increasingly (Microsoft AI) | Medical diagnosis = "4× more accurate" |

**Vragen**:
- If AI can diagnose better than doctors, can AI also:
  - Design buildings better than architects?
  - Write legal briefs better than lawyers?
  - Teach students better than teachers?
  - Make business decisions better than managers?
- "Respect for People" fundamentele vraag: Is this Lean principle alleen relevant when people are economically necessary?
- Jacob Ward (Amazon case): "We like to work people hard." If machines can do the work, will we finally respect people enough to let them REST?
- Or: Is efficiency always the ultimate value, meaning humans are only valued when they're most efficient option?

**Synthesis vraag voor Week 4 reflectie**:
- We've seen 4 cases: Uber (gig workers), Dark Factories (operators), Amazon (warehouse workers), Microsoft (doctors)
- Lean 4.0 combines traditional Lean (efficiency, waste elimination) with Industry 4.0 (AI, robotics, IoT)
- **But**: Traditional Lean had "Respect for People" as foundational principle
- **Question**: In an economy optimized by AI for maximum efficiency, what is the role of people?
  - Are we partners (man with machine)?
  - Are we supervisors (humans manage robots)?
  - Are we beneficiaries (efficiency gains → shorter workweeks, better life)?
  - Or are we temporary (humans until AI is good enough)?

**DOVE-cyclus voor society**:
- **Diagnosticeren**: Automation makes work more efficient, but threatens jobs across skill levels
- **Ontwerpen**: What system do we want? Convictional (32h week) or Amazon (maximize shareholder value)?
- **Veranderen**: How do we implement? Policy (laws), culture (values), market (incentives)?
- **Evalueren**: Success = GDP growth? Employment rate? Worker wellbeing? All three?

**Kernvraag**: Is "Lean 4.0" a philosophy that INCLUDES "respect for people," or is it simply efficiency optimization that happens to sometimes involve humans?
