>> A STEP TOWARD MEDICAL
0:07
SUPERINTELLIGENCE. THAT'S WHAT
0:08
THE CEO OF MICROSOFT IS CALLING
0:09
THE COMPANY'S NEW ARTIFICIAL
0:11
INTELLIGENCE TOOL. SO MICROSOFT
0:13
SAYS IT CAN DIAGNOSE PATIENTS
0:16
FOUR TIMES MORE ACCURATELY THAN
0:17
DOCTORS AND AT A FRACTION OF THE
0:18
COST. SO WITH PEOPLE
0:19
INCREASINGLY TURNING TO THE
0:21
INTERNET TO DIAGNOSE THEIR
0:23
HEALTH TROUBLES, MICROSOFT SAYS,
0:24
I COULD BE TRANSFORMATIONAL. SO
0:26
I WANT TO BRING IN WILL KNIGHT,
0:27
A SENIOR WRITER FOR WIRED, TO
0:30
TALK ABOUT THIS NEW A.I. TOOL.
0:31
THANKS FOR JOINING US. LET'S GET
0:32
RIGHT TO IT. TELL US ABOUT IT.
0:34
>> SURE. YEAH. SO THIS IS THIS
0:35
IS A, YOU KNOW, EXCITING STEP IN
0:39
THIS LONG STANDING VISION TO TO
0:41
USE A.I. TO HELP WITH MEDICAL
0:44
DIAGNOSIS. PLENTY OF WORK HAS
0:45
SHOWN THAT LANGUAGE MODELS, SUCH
0:48
AS THOSE USED IN CHATGPT, CAN
0:50
CAN POTENTIALLY DIAGNOSE
0:53
PEOPLE'S ILLNESS. BUT THIS IS
0:55
THE MOST REALISTIC SIMULATION OF
0:57
THE WAY DOCTORS DO IT. THEY HAD
0:58
THE THE MODEL DO THINGS LIKE
1:00
DEVISE WHAT TESTS A PATIENT
1:02
SHOULD BE GIVEN, AND GO INTO THE
1:04
BACK AND FORTH WITH THAT IS
1:07
INVOLVED WITH DIAGNOSING
1:07
SOMETHING. SO IT'S STILL EARLY
1:09
STAGES, YOU KNOW. BUT THIS THIS
1:10
SHOWS THE POTENTIAL OF A.I. AND
1:12
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE A LOT OF
1:13
PITFALLS. THERE ARE A LOT OF
1:14
ISSUES TO CONSIDER, BUT ONE OF
1:16
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ALSO
1:17
IS THAT THIS THIS SHOWS THAT
1:18
THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR A.I. TO
1:20
REDUCE THE COST, WHICH IS
1:22
OBVIOUSLY SUCH A HUGE ISSUE IN
1:23
HEALTHCARE.
1:25
>> YEAH, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.
1:25
WE KNOW THAT HEALTH CARE IS
1:27
EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE, SO HOW
1:29
COULD THIS TOOL REALLY LOWER THE
1:31
COSTS?
1:32
>> SO IN THEIR IN THEIR
1:33
EXPERIMENT, AT LEAST THEY HAD
1:35
THE MODEL OR THE SERIES OF
1:37
MODELS OPTIMIZED FOR COST. SO
1:38
TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET
1:40
THE RIGHT TREATMENT, GET THE
1:42
RIGHT DIAGNOSIS. BUT FACTOR COST
1:43
INTO THAT AND REDUCE THE COSTS.
1:45
AND SO THAT BECAUSE THE SYSTEM
1:48
IS IS IN SOME WAYS, YOU KNOW,
1:49
THEY CALL IT SUPERINTELLIGENT OR
1:50
A STEP TOWARDS
1:52
SUPERINTELLIGENCE, BUT IT CAN IT
1:53
CAN FACTOR IN A LOT MORE DATA
1:54
THAN, THAN A DOCTOR. SO
1:56
POTENTIALLY IT COULD IT COULD
1:58
HELP REDUCE SOME OF THOSE, THOSE
2:00
COSTS THAT GET INCURRED WITH
2:02
TREATING PATIENTS. I SHOULD
2:03
CAUTION THAT THERE ARE OTHER
2:04
FACTORS THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS
2:05
THIS NEEDS TO BE TESTED IN A IN
2:06
A CLINICAL TRIAL, REALLY,
2:08
BECAUSE THERE ARE THINGS THAT
2:09
THE A.I. DOESN'T CONSIDER, LIKE
2:13
YOUR DOCTOR MAY KNOW WHAT
2:14
INSTRUMENTS ARE AVAILABLE OR
2:14
WHAT KIND OF TESTS A PATIENT
2:15
WOULD BE WILLING TO TO HAVE, AND
2:18
MAY FACTOR THAT INTO THEIR
2:21
CONSIDERATION. SO, YOU KNOW,
2:21
IT'S EARLY DAYS, BUT THERE IS
2:22
THE POTENTIAL THERE TO REDUCE
2:23
THOSE COSTS.
2:25
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN,
2:26
THERE IS THE PATIENT HISTORY AND
2:27
THE CONNECTION THAT A PATIENT
2:28
MAY HAVE WITH THE DOCTOR. SO HOW
2:30
WILL THE AVERAGE PERSON BE ABLE
2:32
TO USE THIS TOOL, AND HOW WILL
2:33
IT ACTUALLY TAKE THE PLACE OF A
2:35
DOCTOR? I KNOW THIS IS THE
2:39
INITIAL STAGES.
2:39
>> YEAH. SO I MEAN, THE I THINK
2:40
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE
2:42
MICROSOFT EXECUTIVE STRESSED TO
2:43
ME WAS THAT IT'S STILL AN EARLY
2:45
STAGE. THEY HAVEN'T DECIDED HOW
2:46
THEY'RE GOING TO DEPLOY IT, BUT
2:48
THEY DID NOTE THAT A LOT OF
2:49
PEOPLE GO TO THEIR SEARCH
2:53
SERVICE, BING AND ENTER, YOU
2:53
KNOW, INFORMATION TRYING TO GET
2:54
A DIAGNOSIS. SO WE MAY WELL SEE
2:56
THIS SORT OF THING BE
2:58
IMPLEMENTED IN IN THOSE KINDS OF
2:59
TOOLS THAT ARE ALREADY WIDELY
3:01
USED TO TRY AND DIAGNOSE
3:02
ILLNESS. BUT IT COULD ALSO
3:04
POTENTIALLY HELP DOCTORS, YOU
3:06
KNOW, DOCTORS ALREADY RELY ON A
3:08
LOT OF TECHNOLOGY. AND ONE ONE
3:09
IMPORTANT THING TO STRESS WITH
3:10
THIS TEST IS THAT THEY ASK THE
3:12
DOCTORS TO TRY AND MAKE THESE
3:13
DIAGNOSES WITHOUT ACCESS TO
3:14
THOSE TOOLS, SO THEY WOULD
3:15
POTENTIALLY BE, YOU KNOW, A
3:17
SIGNIFICANT DISADVANTAGE. AND
3:18
BUT WITH THIS, THEY COULD BE AT
3:19
A BIG, BIG ADVANTAGE BECAUSE
3:21
THEY COULD USE SOMETHING THAT
3:22
CAN FACTOR IN A LOT MORE DATA, A
3:25
LOT MORE INFORMATION, AND
3:27
ANALYZE ALL THOSE RECORDS
