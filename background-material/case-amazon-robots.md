## Transcript 2

0:00
This morning marks exactly three months
0:01
from Christmas and companies are already
0:03
planning for the holiday retail rush.
0:05
43% of Americans intend to start their
0:07
holiday shopping before Halloween this
0:10
year. That's their intention anyway.
0:11
We'll see how that goes. According to
0:13
one study, Money Watch correspondent got a
0:15
behind-the-scenes look at how Amazon is
0:17
using robots to speed up deliveries. But
0:20
will those robots lead to job cuts for
0:22
humans?
0:24
When you click buy this holiday season,
0:26
there's a good chance
0:29
a robot like this is helping to fulfill
0:31
your order. And with online holiday
0:33
sales expected to grow up to 9% over
0:36
last year, major retailers, including
0:38
Walmart and Amazon, along with shipping
0:40
carriers like UPS and FedEx are
0:42
investing big in robotics. So, what does
0:45
all that automation mean for the holiday
0:47
season? We're in Shreveport, Louisiana,
0:49
getting a behind-the-scenes tour of
0:51
Amazon's most advanced fulfillment
0:53
center. It's called SHV1, and at more
0:56
than 3 million square feet, Amazon says
0:59
it's one of the company's largest
1:00
facilities.
1:01
We have a number of different types of
1:03
new robotics that we're using to fulfill
1:05
customer orders.
1:06
Is that one of them?
1:07
Great example of one right here. A very
1:09
noisy one right here.
1:10
Scott Dresser is Amazon's vice president
1:12
of robotics. He introduced us to that
1:15
robot in Proteus, one of almost a
1:17
thousand in SHV1.
1:19
So, does this facility run 24/7?
1:21
So, it can run 24 hours a day and the
1:24
robots we designed to run all day long
1:25
if they if they need to. Certainly, as
1:28
we come into our peak holiday season,
1:30
which we're already getting ready for,
1:31
that's something we think about a lot
1:32
because we will have to run the building
1:34
almost all all day around.
1:35
When a customer orders a product, the
1:37
robots get to work. These ones move the
1:39
item out of storage. Then one of the
1:42
2500 employees sorts it while another
1:44
packs it before it travels along some of
1:47
the nearly 15 miles of conveyor belts to
1:50
get labeled. Meet Cardinal.
1:52
Cardinal is lifting packages that weigh
1:54
up to 50 lbs. And then we can use
1:56
Proteus to take the the container over
1:59
to the dock. So a lot of it's less about
2:00
performance, more about making sure that
2:02
our employees are safe.
2:03
The final step here, a human loads the
2:05
packages onto a truck. Dresser says SHV1
2:09
is 25% more efficient than other
2:11
fulfillment centers.
2:12
If you're ordering an order here in
2:14
Shreveport right before Christmas and
2:16
you need that by Christmas, robots are
2:18
going to help make sure we get that
2:19
product to you fast, safely, and
2:21
accurately.
2:21
He says while the robots are replacing
2:24
some jobs, they're also creating new
2:26
ones. Every time we're able to grow and
2:28
expand the network, which robotics has
2:30
enabled over the last decade, we're able
2:32
to add new jobs like our robotics
2:34
maintenance engineers, people that we
2:36
need in the operation now that we have
2:37
these new robotics to help us run the
2:39
building.
2:40
While Amazon's revenue has grown, its
2:42
number of employees has held steady
2:44
around 1.5 million since 2022.
2:47
You are a public company. You have a
2:48
duty to your shareholders to maximize
2:51
profit. At what point does that become
2:55
more important than ensuring that
2:58
there's always a human element dealing
3:01
with something like Proteus?
3:02
The thing that we think of most when
3:04
we're when we're deploying a a new
3:06
fulfillment operation or a new process
3:08
in a fulfillment operation is how are
3:10
people and robots best going to be able
3:12
to do that together?
3:13
So, man with machine versus man versus
3:16
machine.
3:16
It's always man with machine.
3:19
Now, he added that Amazon is offering
3:21
training for employees whose positions
3:23
are being replaced and shared those more
3:25
advanced jobs pay better. When we
3:27
pressed him on if those jobs could ever
3:30
be replaced, he said robots, they're
3:31
always breaking down. They need
3:33
assistance and that humans will be
3:35
needed for those roles.
3:36
How did you feel being there?
3:38
It felt very advanced, but it was a
3:40
little bit strange. You just have these
3:42
robots moving around, but they have
3:43
those googly eyes. They're kind of cute.
3:45
Uh-oh. Anthropomorphicizing. Is that the
3:48
word we learned yesterday? Saw a face on
3:50
humanizing. Yes.
3:51
Take those eyes off of there. We got to
3:53
remind ourselves it's a robot.
3:55
Kelly, thank you very much. Appreciate
3:56
it. Good luck to those people planning
3:57
to shop for Christmas before
3:59

0:00
>> ALL RIGHT. IAN LEE. IAN,
0:02
THANKS SO MUCH. ON TO AMAZON.
0:04
AMAZON COULD SOON HAVE MORE
0:06
ROBOTS THAN HUMANS WORKING IN
0:07
ITS WAREHOUSES. THE WALL STREET
0:09
JOURNAL REPORTS AMAZON NEARS THE
0:11
MILESTONE AFTER YEARS SPENT
0:12
WORKING TO AUTOMATE TASKS
0:15
PREVIOUSLY DONE BY HUMANS. SO
0:16
RIGHT NOW, THE E-COMMERCE GIANT
0:19
HAS OVER 1 MILLION ROBOTS IN ITS
0:21
WORKPLACES. SO I WANT TO BRING
0:23
IN JACOB WARD IN STUDIO
0:25
TECHNOLOGY, JOURNALIST AND HOST
0:26
OF THE RIP, CURRENT PODCAST. ALL
0:29
RIGHT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
0:31
AMAZON'S GROWING ROBOT
0:33
WORKFORCE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
0:33
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR
0:36
TECHNOLOGY AND HUMANS DOING THE
0:37
WORK?
0:37
>> WELL, THIS IS THE THING,
0:38
RIGHT? AMAZON SINCE 2012 HAS
0:39
BEEN ON THIS PATH. THE PATTERN
0:40
HAS BEEN CLEAR. THEY'VE BEEN
0:41
SAYING OVER AND OVER AGAIN, WE
0:42
WANT TO AUTOMATE AS MUCH AS WE
0:43
POSSIBLY CAN. AT ONE POINT, THIS
0:45
WAS JUST, YOU, A MATTER OF
0:48
CONVENIENCE AND EFFICIENCY. IT
0:49
IS NOW BECOMING EXISTENTIAL,
0:50
RIGHT? THIS IS A COMPANY THAT
0:51
REALLY BELIEVES IT CANNOT DO
0:53
WHAT IT WANTS TO DO TO BE THIS
0:55
ENORMOUS, EFFICIENT MACHINE
0:57
UNLESS IT CAN GET ENORMOUS,
0:58
EFFICIENT MACHINES WORKING IN
0:59
THERE. THIS HAS LED, OF COURSE,
1:01
TO SOME LAYOFFS, RIGHT? WE'VE
1:03
GOT AT LEAST 27,000 PEOPLE LAID
1:04
OFF IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. THIS
1:05
IS, OF COURSE, STILL ONE OF THE
1:06
LARGEST PRIVATE EMPLOYERS IN THE
1:08
UNITED STATES, BUT IT IS
1:10
DEFINITELY THE CASE THAT THEY
1:10
ARE GOING TO DO AWAY WITH SOME
1:12
JOBS. THE CEO YESTERDAY WAS
1:14
TALKING TO JIM CRAMER, EVEN
1:15
SAID, WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING,
1:16
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE
1:18
DOING FEWER JOBS AS WE AUTOMATE
1:19
MORE THIS KIND OF THING IS JUST,
1:21
YOU KNOW, WE CAN ALL SEE WHERE
1:22
THIS IS GOING.
1:24
>> TO KIND OF INEVITABLE. OKAY.
1:25
BUT I DO WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE
1:26
BECAUSE YOU HAD KIND OF THE
1:27
FIRSTHAND LOOK AT SOME OF THE
1:30
PROTOTYPE AMAZON ROBOTS. SO WHAT
1:31
DOES THAT LOOK LIKE? AND HOW
1:33
DOES THAT SHAPE YOUR PERSPECTIVE
1:34
ON THIS FUTURE WITH ROBOTS?
1:35
>> YEAH. SO ABOUT A YEAR AND A
1:36
HALF AGO, I GOT INVITED TO GO
1:37
LOOK AT SOME OF THE EARLY
1:38
PROTOTYPES OF A OF A WHOLE SORT
1:40
OF SECTION OF THEM THAT WAS
1:41
SUPPOSED TO BE ONE YOU COULD
1:42
BASICALLY NOT REQUIRE ANY
1:44
TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND STILL
1:45
PROGRAM THE THING. YOU COULD
1:46
SAY, GO PICK UP THE BLUE BIN.
1:47
OKAY, BRING IT OVER HERE WITHOUT
1:49
HAVING TO HAVE ANY KIND OF, YOU
1:50
KNOW, PROGRAMING CHOPS. SO THAT
1:52
KIND OF YOU KNOW, CASUAL
1:54
OVERSIGHT MAKES YOU REALIZE, YOU
1:55
KNOW, EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY WE'RE
1:57
GOING TO BE TRAINING UP PEOPLE
1:58
INTO NEW, MORE TECHNICAL JOBS,
1:59
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE THAT
2:00
TECHNICAL. IF IN THE FUTURE YOU
2:01
CAN REALLY JUST SAY, HEY, ROBOT,
2:03
GRAB THIS, BRING IT OVER HERE.
2:05
>> PLEASE.
2:06
>> PLEASE, MAYBE, MAYBE, PLEASE.
2:07
WE HOPE WE'RE ALL SAYING PLEASE.
2:08
>> ALL RIGHT. AS TECHNOLOGY
2:09
TAKES OVER HUMAN TASKS IN THE
2:11
WORKFORCE, THOUGH SOME SAY
2:12
INSTEAD OF FIRING WORKERS,
2:14
COMPANIES COULD ACTUALLY GIVE
2:15
THEM MORE TIME OFF. HOW ABOUT
2:16
THAT? SO EARLIER, CBS MORNING
2:18
NEWS TALKED TO THE CEO OF A TECH
2:20
STARTUP WHO MOVED HIS COMPANY TO
2:22
A 32 HOUR WORKWEEK WITH NO
2:24
CHANGE IN PAY BECAUSE OF A.I.
2:26
HERE IS ROGER KIRKNESS ON WHAT
2:30
INSPIRED THE SWITCH AT HIS
2:32
COMPANY CONVICTIONAL.
2:32
>> WE'VE BEEN USING CHATGPT
2:34
SINCE THE DAY THAT IT CAME OUT,
2:35
AND I REALIZED AFTER USING THE
2:38
MOST RECENT MODELS FROM
2:38
ANTHROPIC AND OPENAI THAT THE
2:41
THAT THE A.I. WOULD START TO GET
2:43
SERIOUS WORK DONE. AND SO WHERE
2:44
BEFORE I WAS MORE OF A GENIUS
2:46
BUT IMPRACTICAL ASSISTANT, NOW
2:47
YOU COULD USE IT IN A WAY THAT
2:48
IT WAS MORE LIKE A TEAM OF 4 TO
2:49
5 PEOPLE. AND I NOTICED AS OUR
2:53
TEAM ACCELERATED OUR WORK WITH
2:53
A.I. AGENTS, THAT A NEW KIND OF
2:55
BURNOUT SET IN, WHEREAS A
2:57
CONSTANT DECISION FATIGUE OF
2:58
WHAT TO BUILD AND HOW TO BUILD
3:00
IT, THAT ACTUALLY REDUCED
3:02
PEOPLE'S CREATIVITY. SO I WANTED
3:02
TO MAXIMIZE THE THINGS THAT LED
3:04
TO OUR GOAL OF CREATING NEW AND
3:08
VALUABLE TECHNOLOGY.
3:08
>> OKAY, SO COULD THIS BE A
3:11
TREND? COULD I GIVE US MORE FREE
3:12
TIME?
3:13
>> JULIA I HOPE SO, BUT I HAVE
3:15
TO SAY, LIKE, I HOPE EVERY CEO
3:16
IS AS COOL AS THIS GUY, BUT I
3:18
DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE
3:19
THE CASE. I MEAN, FIRST OF ALL,
3:20
HE'S A STARTUP FOUNDER, RIGHT?
3:22
SO HE'S OBVIOUSLY GOT BACKERS
3:23
THAT ARE OKAY WITH THIS. BUT AS
3:24
SOON AS THAT GUY GOES PUBLIC,
3:25
HE'S GOING TO BE UNDER ALL
3:26
KINDS OF PRESSURE. THE PATTERN
3:27
WE HAVE SEEN IN THE HISTORY OF
3:29
CAPITALISM IN THE UNITED STATES
3:31
IS WHEN YOU USE A THING MORE
3:32
EFFICIENTLY, YOU USE MORE OF IT.
3:33
SO WHEN YOU USE MORE, YOU KNOW,
3:36
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU CAN MAKE MORE
3:37
EFFICIENT USE OF SOMEONE'S TIME,
3:37
YOU'RE IN FACT GOING TO TAKE
3:39
MORE OF THAT TIME. AND
3:41
ESPECIALLY WHEN SHAREHOLDERS ARE
3:42
INVOLVED AND SAYING, BE MORE
3:43
EFFICIENT, BE MORE PRODUCTIVE,
3:44
BE MORE PROFITABLE, I JUST
3:46
DON'T SEE IT. I WOULD LIKE TO
3:48
SEE THAT. THIS IS WHY BERNIE
3:49
SANDERS INTRODUCED LAST YEAR A
3:51
32 HOUR WORKWEEK BILL. THAT'S
3:52
NOT REALLY GOING TO GO ANYWHERE
3:53
IN TODAY'S SENATE. BUT, YOU
3:55
KNOW, OBVIOUSLY THAT COULD
3:56
HAPPEN IF WE CAME TOGETHER AS A
3:57
SOCIETY AROUND IT. BUT OUR
3:58
HISTORY HAS BEEN WE LIKE TO WORK
4:00
PEOPLE HARD.
4:00
>> YEAH. THAT'S TRUE. WELL,
4:01
THANK YOU FOR

## Discussion Questions for Students

### 1. The 6th S - Substitute
**Context**: Traditional Lean's 5S = Sort, Set in order, Shine, Standardize, Sustain. Amazon adds unofficial 6th S: **Substitute** (humans with robots).

**Vragen**:
- Is "Substitute" een logische evolutie van 5S, of fundamenteel anders?
- 5S gaat over workplace organization. Wat zegt het als je "workers" zelf als iets ziet dat georganiseerd/vervangen moet worden?
- Amazon VP: "Man with machine, not man versus machine" - maar video toont 1M+ robots, 27k layoffs, 600k niet-aangenomen mensen. Wat is de waarheid?
- Als Sustain (5S #5) betekent "maintain improvements over time", wat sustain je dan? Process efficiency of workforce?

**Table VII Link**:
- Welke combinatie beschrijft Amazon's strategie?
- #15: Continuous Improvement + Machine Learning? (robots leren, mensen niet?)
- Of is dit iets nieuws: "5S + Workforce Substitution"?

### 2. Drie Narratieven - Welke is waar?
**Context**: Video 1 (Aaron Martin: upskilling success), Video 2 (Scott Dresser: man WITH machine), Video 3 (Jacob Ward: systemic job replacement + 27k layoffs)

**Analyse**:
- **Video 1 Narrative**: Aaron Martin ging van bin-stocking naar robot programming. "This isn't Terminator."
- **Video 2 Narrative**: VP Robotics toont facility, zegt "robots create new jobs like maintenance engineers."
- **Video 3 Narrative**: Jacob Ward: "They're NOT going to be that technical. You just say 'Hey robot, grab this.'"

**Vragen**:
- Alle drie videos zijn "waar", maar welke vertelt het **hele** verhaal?
- Aaron Martin = 1 persoon. Hoeveel Aaron Martins zijn er vs. hoeveel vervangen workers?
- Scott Dresser laat zien: "2500 employees" in facility van 3 million sq ft met 1000 robots. Ratio = 2.5 workers per robot. Houdbaar?
- Jacob Ward's punt: Als robots zo easy-to-program worden, waarom zou je überhaupt workers "upskill"?

**Lean principe**: Ga naar Gemba, observeer zelf. Maar welke Gemba: Innovation Lab (Video 1), Corporate Tour (Video 2), of data analysis (Video 3)?

### 3. "Upskilling" - Mythe of Realiteit?
**Context**:
- Amazon claim: "300,000 US employees trained for new roles"
- Reality check: Employee count flat at 1.5M since 2022, despite revenue growth
- Jacob Ward: Programming = "Hey robot, grab this" - not technical

**DOVE-cyclus analyse**:
- **Diagnosticeren**: Probleem = robots vervangen repetitive tasks. Solution = upskilling?
- **Ontwerpen**: Amazon's Career Choice program - workers betalen om te studeren tijdens werk
- **Veranderen**: 300k trained... maar hoeveel kregen daadwerkelijk nieuwe jobs?
- **Evalueren**: Success metric = # trained? Of # employed in new roles? Verschil is cruciaal!

**Vragen**:
- Is "upskilling" een genuine solution, of een PR narrative om job displacement te rechtvaardigen?
- Aaron Martin's vraag: "You've got to pay to go to school" - is dit eerlijk? Wie profiteert van automation gains?
- Als robots "create" maintenance jobs, maar eliminate 10× meer picking/packing jobs, is dat netto positief?

**TIM WOOD toepassing**:
- Amazon optimaliseert voor waste reduction: Wachttijd (robots 24/7), Motion (conveyor belts), Defects (AI quality control)
- Maar: Is workforce reduction "waste elimination" of "value destruction"?

### 4. Jevons Paradox - Efficiency Breeds Demand
**Context**: Jacob Ward's historische punt: "When you use a thing more efficiently, you use MORE of it. When you can make more efficient use of someone's time, you're in fact going to take MORE of that time."

**Jevons Paradox uitleg**:
- 19e eeuw: Efficient steam engines → MEER coal consumption, niet minder
- Today: Efficient robots → MORE work demanded from remaining humans, niet shorter hours

**Vragen**:
- Convictional's 32-hour week = exception. Amazon's reality = "we like to work people hard."
- SHV1 facility = 25% more efficient than older warehouses. Wat gebeurt er met die 25% gain?
  - Option A: Workers work 25% less hours, same pay (Convictional model)
  - Option B: Same workers handle 25% more orders (Jevons Paradox)
  - Option C: 20% fewer workers handle same orders, 5% cost savings to shareholders
- Welke optie is realistisch? Welke zien we in data (flat employment, revenue growth)?

**Lean 4.0 dilemma**:
- Lean's doel: Eliminate waste to create value
- Industry 4.0's capability: Eliminate waste with automation
- Result: Who captures the value? Workers (time off) or shareholders (profit)?

### 5. "Man with Machine" vs. "Man versus Machine"
**Context**: Scott Dresser's claim: "It's always man with machine." Reality: 27,000 layoffs, 600,000 not hired by 2033.

**Analyse**:
- **"Man with Machine" scenario**:
  - Robots lift 50 lbs (Cardinal), humans load trucks
  - Robots move packages (Proteus), humans sort/pack
  - This is current state (Video 2)

- **"Man versus Machine" trajectory**:
  - 2022: 1.5M employees
  - 2024: Still 1.5M employees, but revenue grew
  - 2033 projection: 600k fewer hires needed (NYT report)
  - That's 40% workforce reduction through attrition

**Vragen**:
- Is "man with machine" a permanent state, or transition phase toward "machine without man"?
- Dresser's quote: "Robots are always breaking down, need assistance." Is dit sustainable argument voor human jobs?
- Als je robot maintenance engineer wordt, maar robots become more reliable (improvement goal!), is je job secure?

**Respect for People vergelijking**:
- **Toyota's Lean**: Operators improve processes, gain skills, job security through contribution
- **Amazon's Lean 4.0**: Robots improve efficiency, workers retrain, job security through... what exactly?

**Fundamentele vraag**:
- If Lean's goal is "eliminate waste," and human labor is expensive/error-prone, is human labor inherently "waste"?
- Or is "respect for people" a constraint that limits optimization?

### 6. Alternative Futures - 32-Hour Week vs. Warehouse Expansion
**Context**: Video 3 shows two paths:
- Path A (Convictional): Use AI gains → 32-hour week, no pay cut
- Path B (Amazon): Use automation gains → same hours, more output, higher profits

**Vergelijking**:
| Dimension | Convictional (Path A) | Amazon (Path B) |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Efficiency gains** | Shared with workers (time) | Captured by shareholders (profit) |
| **Worker wellbeing** | Reduced burnout, more creativity | "We like to work people hard" |
| **Lean principle** | Kaizen = improve work for workers | Kaizen = improve output for customers |
| **Sustainability** | Startup, private, founder control | Public company, shareholder pressure |

**Vragen**:
- Jacob Ward: "As soon as that guy goes public, he's under all kinds of pressure." Wat zegt dit over capitalism vs. Lean values?
- Is Path A (Convictional) realistic at scale? Or only possible for small startups?
- Bernie Sanders' 32-hour workweek bill: "Not going anywhere in today's Senate." Waarom niet? What does this say about societal priorities?
- Als we als society willen dat efficiency gains → better work/life balance instead of just → higher profits, what needs to change?

**DOVE-cyclus voor society-level change**:
- **Diagnosticeren**: Automation creates productivity gains, but workers don't benefit
- **Ontwerpen**: Policy options (4-day week laws, profit-sharing mandates, UBI, etc.)
- **Veranderen**: How do you implement against shareholder pressure?
- **Evalueren**: What does success look like? GDP growth? Worker happiness? Both?

**Kernvraag**:
- Is "Lean 4.0" inherently aligned with shareholder capitalism?
- Or can we design Lean 4.0 systems that prioritize worker wellbeing equally with efficiency?
