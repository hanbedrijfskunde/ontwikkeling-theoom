This morning marks exactly three months
0:01
from Christmas and companies are already
0:03
planning for the holiday retail rush.
0:05
43% of Americans intend to start their
0:07
holiday shopping before Halloween this
0:10
year. That's their intention anyway.
0:11
We'll see how that goes. According to
0:13
one study, Money Watch correspondent got a
0:15
behind-the-scenes look at how Amazon is
0:17
using robots to speed up deliveries. But
0:20
will those robots lead to job cuts for
0:22
humans?
0:24
When you click buy this holiday season,
0:26
there's a good chance
0:29
a robot like this is helping to fulfill
0:31
your order. And with online holiday
0:33
sales expected to grow up to 9% over
0:36
last year, major retailers, including
0:38
Walmart and Amazon, along with shipping
0:40
carriers like UPS and FedEx are
0:42
investing big in robotics. So, what does
0:45
all that automation mean for the holiday
0:47
season? We're in Shreveport, Louisiana,
0:49
getting a behind-the-scenes tour of
0:51
Amazon's most advanced fulfillment
0:53
center. It's called SHV1, and at more
0:56
than 3 million square feet, Amazon says
0:59
it's one of the company's largest
1:00
facilities.
1:01
We have a number of different types of
1:03
new robotics that we're using to fulfill
1:05
customer orders.
1:06
Is that one of them?
1:07
Great example of one right here. A very
1:09
noisy one right here.
1:10
Scott Dresser is Amazon's vice president
1:12
of robotics. He introduced us to that
1:15
robot in Proteus, one of almost a
1:17
thousand in SHV1.
1:19
So, does this facility run 24/7?
1:21
So, it can run 24 hours a day and the
1:24
robots we designed to run all day long
1:25
if they if they need to. Certainly, as
1:28
we come into our peak holiday season,
1:30
which we're already getting ready for,
1:31
that's something we think about a lot
1:32
because we will have to run the building
1:34
almost all all day around.
1:35
When a customer orders a product, the
1:37
robots get to work. These ones move the
1:39
item out of storage. Then one of the
1:42
2500 employees sorts it while another
1:44
packs it before it travels along some of
1:47
the nearly 15 miles of conveyor belts to
1:50
get labeled. Meet Cardinal.
1:52
Cardinal is lifting packages that weigh
1:54
up to 50 lbs. And then we can use
1:56
Proteus to take the the container over
1:59
to the dock. So a lot of it's less about
2:00
performance, more about making sure that
2:02
our employees are safe.
2:03
The final step here, a human loads the
2:05
packages onto a truck. Dresser says SHV1
2:09
is 25% more efficient than other
2:11
fulfillment centers.
2:12
If you're ordering an order here in
2:14
Shreveport right before Christmas and
2:16
you need that by Christmas, robots are
2:18
going to help make sure we get that
2:19
product to you fast, safely, and
2:21
accurately.
2:21
He says while the robots are replacing
2:24
some jobs, they're also creating new
2:26
ones. Every time we're able to grow and
2:28
expand the network, which robotics has
2:30
enabled over the last decade, we're able
2:32
to add new jobs like our robotics
2:34
maintenance engineers, people that we
2:36
need in the operation now that we have
2:37
these new robotics to help us run the
2:39
building.
2:40
While Amazon's revenue has grown, its
2:42
number of employees has held steady
2:44
around 1.5 million since 2022.
2:47
You are a public company. You have a
2:48
duty to your shareholders to maximize
2:51
profit. At what point does that become
2:55
more important than ensuring that
2:58
there's always a human element dealing
3:01
with something like Proteus?
3:02
The thing that we think of most when
3:04
we're when we're deploying a a new
3:06
fulfillment operation or a new process
3:08
in a fulfillment operation is how are
3:10
people and robots best going to be able
3:12
to do that together?
3:13
So, man with machine versus man versus
3:16
machine.
3:16
It's always man with machine.
3:19
Now, he added that Amazon is offering
3:21
training for employees whose positions
3:23
are being replaced and shared those more
3:25
advanced jobs pay better. When we
3:27
pressed him on if those jobs could ever
3:30
be replaced, he said robots, they're
3:31
always breaking down. They need
3:33
assistance and that humans will be
3:35
needed for those roles.
3:36
How did you feel being there?
3:38
It felt very advanced, but it was a
3:40
little bit strange. You just have these
3:42
robots moving around, but they have
3:43
those googly eyes. They're kind of cute.
3:45
Uh-oh. Anthropomorphicizing. Is that the
3:48
word we learned yesterday? Saw a face on
3:50
humanizing. Yes.
3:51
Take those eyes off of there. We got to
3:53
remind ourselves it's a robot.
3:55
Kelly, thank you very much. Appreciate
3:56
it. Good luck to those people planning
3:57
to shop for Christmas before
