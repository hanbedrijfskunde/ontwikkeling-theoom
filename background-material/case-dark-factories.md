- [Reporter] With lights dimmed and no workers in sight,
0:04
this car factory in China uses hundreds of robots
0:07
to churn out dozens of electric vehicles an hour 24/7.
0:13
This is a dark factory, an area of the plant so automated
0:17
and with so little human presence
0:19
that in theory the lights could be completely shut off.
0:23
Factories like this one are part of China's bid
0:26
to use hyper automation to dominate the electric vehicle
0:29
or EV market.
0:31
But the furious trade war between Washington
0:33
and Beijing raises a key question,
0:36
who is going to buy all these new cars?
China’s labor costs
0:40
For decades, the abundance of cheap labor
0:43
explained why China was seen
0:45
as the world's factory floor, but the economy is changing.
0:49
- The labor costs had been going up in China for many years.
0:53
I think it happened faster than many people
0:54
in the West expected.
0:55
And so if you're a factory owner, you wanna find a way
0:58
to blunt the impact of that
1:00
and automation is one very obvious way.
1:03
- [Reporter] Rapid advancements in robotization
1:05
has helped create what is now known as dark factories.
Inside Zeekr
1:20
This is ZEEKR, a Chinese luxury EV maker founded in 2021,
1:25
whose cars cost up to $125,000 a piece.
1:28
In its flagship factory in northeastern China,
1:31
the automaker can already produce up to 300,000 cars a year
1:35
or more than 800 cars a day.
1:38
For comparison, Tesla has similar production levels,
1:41
but it took more than a decade to achieve this volume.
1:44
For ZEEKR, robotization has a double advantage.
2:02
Some tasks still require a human touch,
2:05
such as the meticulous assembly of the cables
2:07
that run throughout the car.
2:09
Workers also go into the factories
2:11
to perform tasks like robot maintenance.
2:14
The company's ambition is to keep automating,
2:17
to deliver its cars to customers even faster.
China’s automation
2:21
In China, ZEEKR is not an outlier in automation.
2:24
According to the International Federation of Robotics
2:27
in 2023, every other industrial robot
2:30
installed in the world happened in China.
2:33
The country's levels of robotization have grown sevenfold
2:36
since 2015 when President Xi Jinping introduced
2:39
a Made in China 2025 initiative
2:42
to transform its image from the world's factory
2:45
into an innovative manufacturing powerhouse.
2:48
- And the aims are to be able to produce
2:51
more of what China needs at home
2:53
and to get to a level of technological advancement
2:56
where they don't need to rely on the US
2:59
and Western countries anymore for inputs
3:01
or to reduce that reliance as much as possible,
3:03
and even to be able to produce enough that they can export.
3:07
And part of that was to have robotics play a larger role
3:11
in the Chinese economy.
U.S. playing catchup
3:13
- [Reporter] Some American automakers
3:14
believe China's widening EV lead
3:16
boosted by cheap state loans and subsidies,
3:19
poses an existential threat to the industry.
3:22
- When you have a country like China
3:24
where much of the auto industry is increasingly automated,
3:28
the sky is the limit in terms of what they can produce.
3:30
And if that means a flood of EVs
3:34
or other vehicles on global markets,
3:36
that is going to have the effect
3:38
of just pulling down prices,
3:39
and that's gonna hurt Western automakers
3:41
that are trying to compete with these.
3:43
- [Reporter] Unlike their Chinese rivals,
3:45
companies like Ford and GM have scaled back
3:48
ambitious EV expansion plans hampered by high battery costs
3:52
and the slow rollouts of EV chargers.
3:55
Staffing costs and labor laws in the West
3:57
are another disadvantage the US faces.
4:00
- China has a lot less in the way
4:03
of labor regulation than many Western countries.
4:06
They don't have labor unions to deal with in the same way,
4:09
so there are fewer impediments to automating.
Challenges in the Chinese economy
4:13
- [Reporter] But China's EV landscape is a crowded space
4:16
and fast robotization makes this competition even tighter.
4:20
Chinese companies already turn out more EVs than all other
4:23
car makers in the world combined.
4:26
But Western concerns about Beijing's EV expansion
4:29
have so far largely kept Chinese brands
4:32
out of their markets.
4:34
- Countries that have friendlier relations with China,
4:36
like Brazil, countries in the Middle East, in Africa,
4:39
in Southeast Asia, are worried as well about their own
4:42
domestic industries and don't want to see a flood
4:45
of Chinese products undermine those industries.
4:48
If you have automation enabling China to go even faster
4:52
and produce even more of this stuff,
4:54
then this political problem becomes perhaps even greater.
4:59
- [Reporter] As a result, most of these cars are sold
5:01
inside China, making over capacity
5:04
a huge issue for the industry.
5:06
But this doesn't dent ZEEKR's confidence
5:08
in China's capacity to consume.

## Discussion Questions for Students

### 1. Gemba Walk Paradox
**Context**: Traditionele Lean: "Go see" = physically walk the floor, observe waste, talk to operators.

**Vragen**:
- Wat zie je in een dark factory? Wat kun je NIET zien?
- Als je geen operators kunt vragen "Why?", hoe doe je dan root cause analysis?
- ZEEKR produceert 800 cars/day in 3 jaar tijd (vs. Tesla 10+ jaar). Wat leer je NIET als je deze learning curve overslaat?
- Is een "Gemba Walk" in een dark factory nog wel Gemba? Of is het gewoon een factory tour?

### 2. Table VII Combinaties - Welke lost het Gemba probleem op?
**Context**: Lean 4.0 combineert traditionele Lean tools met Industry 4.0 technologieën.

**Opties om te overwegen**:
- **#1**: Gemba Walk + Digital Twin = Virtual factory tour met real-time IoT data?
- **#6**: VSM + Process Mapping Software = Live dashboard ipv clipboards?
- **#10**: Jidoka + AI-Powered Monitoring = Robots stoppen zichzelf bij afwijkingen?

**Discussie**:
- Welke combinatie lost het "no humans to observe" probleem op?
- Wat gaat er verloren als je Gemba Walk vervangt door een dashboard?
- Kan een Digital Twin dezelfde inzichten geven als physical presence?

### 3. "Respect for People" - Kan dat zonder people?
**Context**: Lean principe: Operators zijn experts, continuous improvement komt van de vloer.

**Fundamentele vragen**:
- Kun je "respect for people" hebben in een factory zonder people?
- Is extreme automation het **ultieme** Lean (elimineer alle verspilling), of het **tegenovergestelde**?
- ZEEKR's workers: Cable assembly, robot maintenance. Is dit "respect" (veilig werk) of marginalisering?

**Vergelijking**:
- Toyota's Lean: "Build people before building products"
- Dark Factories: "Eliminate people, build products 24/7"

**Vraag**: Zijn deze filosofieën nog familie van elkaar?

### 4. Speed vs. Learning Trade-off
**Context**: ZEEKR behaalt in 3 jaar wat Tesla in 10+ deed.

**Analyse**:
- Tesla's 10 jaar: Failures, Kaizen, operator feedback, iterative learning
- ZEEKR's 3 jaar: Copy best practices, automate immediately, skip learning curve
- **Vraag**: Mis je iets als je deze learning curve overslaat met automation?

**Organizational Learning perspectief**:
- Tesla learned HOW to make EVs (organizational capability)
- ZEEKR learned THAT you can automate EV production (implementation)
- Verschil: Knowledge creation vs. knowledge application

**Toekomst scenario**:
- Als markt verandert, wie kan zich sneller aanpassen?
- Company met 10 jaar learning experience (Tesla)?
- Of company met 3 jaar automation experience (ZEEKR)?

### 5. "Made in China 2025" - Volume of Value?
**Context**: 50% van alle industrial robots worldwide, 7× growth since 2015.

**Dilemma's**:
- **Volume**: ZEEKR produceert 300,000 cars/jaar, maar most sold domestically (overcapacity)
- **Value**: Is dit Lean's "value for customer" als je overproductie hebt?
- **TIM WOOD**: Overproduction = waste #1 in traditional Lean. Maar dark factories maken overproductie gemakkelijk!

**Discussie**:
- China's strategie: "Produce enough to export + dominate markets"
- Lean's principe: "Produce only what customer pulls (Just-In-Time)"
- **Vraag**: Is "Made in China 2025" eigenlijk anti-Lean? Of is dit Lean at national scale?

### 6. Western Automakers Dilemma
**Context**: Ford/GM scale back EV plans, hampered by labor costs and unions.

**Trade-offs**:
- **China**: No unions, less regulation, fast automation → Overcapacity
- **West**: Labor unions, safety regulations, slow automation → Can't compete

**Vragen**:
- Is labor regulation "waste" (verhoogt costs) of "value" (beschermt workers)?
- Chinese advantage: "Fewer impediments to automation" - is dit eerlijk?
- If West adopts dark factories to compete, wat gebeurt er met workers?

**Lean 4.0 ethiek**:
- Efficiency competition → Race to the bottom (eliminate all labor)?
- Or: Different models can coexist (high-automation vs. high-labor)?
