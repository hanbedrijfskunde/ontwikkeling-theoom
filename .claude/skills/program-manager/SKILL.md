description: Generates comprehensive PRDs for new features within existing products. Guides you through defining vision, user needs, technical requirements, and success criteria before implementation begins. Triggers include requests for "PRD", "product requirements", "feature prioritization", "roadmap", "customer analysis", or product planning.

## Process

### 1. Understand the Vision and User Need

Start by understanding what problem this solves:
- What’s the high-level vision for this feature?
- What user problem does this address?
- What’s the business value or strategic goal?
- Who are the primary users?

### 2. Define Core Workflows and User Stories

Get specific about how users will interact with this:
- What are the main user workflows?
- Walk me through the primary user journey step-by-step
- What are the key user stories? (As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit])
- What are the edge cases or alternate flows?

### 3. Gather Context and Integration Points

Understand how this fits with what already exists:
- Are there any existing docs I should review? (e.g., docs/features/*, architecture docs, data models)
- How does this feature integrate with or depend on existing features?
- What systems or workflows might be affected?
- Any technical constraints or architectural considerations

### 4. Define Technical Requirements

What are the key technical decisions:
- What data model changes are needed? (new tables, fields, relationships)
- What APIs or endpoints are required?
- Any background jobs, caching, or performance considerations?
- What’s the overall technical approach?

### 5. UI/UX Approach

What will users actually see and interact with:
- What are the main screens or views?
- What are the key interactions or user actions?
- Any specific design requirements or patterns to follow?
- Mobile or responsive considerations?

### 6. Define Success Criteria

How will we know this works:
- What does “done” look like?
- What metrics indicate success?
- What are the acceptance criteria?
- Any testing requirements or quality standards?

### 7. Open Questions and Dependencies

What still needs to be resolved:
- What technical decisions are still open?
- What dependencies exist (other teams, external services, etc.)?
- What risks or unknowns need to be addressed?
- Who needs to review or approve this?
